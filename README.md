# Dygus Backend - Plumbing E-commerce Platform

## Docker Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to run Dygus is using Docker. This will set up PostgreSQL, Redis, and your application automatically.

### Quick Start with Docker

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**:
   ```bash
   cd dygus-backend
   ```

2. **Start all services**:
   ```bash
   npm run docker:compose:up
   ```

3. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app npm run db:migrate
   ```

4. **Seed the database** (optional):
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app npm run db:seed
   ```

5. **Access your application**:
   - **API**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Prisma Studio**: http://localhost:5555
   - **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432
   - **Redis**: localhost:6379

### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start services
npm run docker:compose:up

# Stop services
npm run docker:compose:down

# View logs
npm run docker:compose:logs

# Restart services
npm run docker:compose:restart

# Build containers
npm run docker:compose:build

# Production deployment
npm run docker:compose:prod

# Clean up Docker resources
npm run docker:clean
```

### Docker Services

- **PostgreSQL**: Database with persistent storage
- **Redis**: Caching layer
- **App**: NestJS application
- **Prisma Studio**: Database management UI (optional)

## PostgreSQL Migration Setup

This project has been migrated from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. Follow these steps to set up your PostgreSQL database for the Dygus plumbing e-commerce platform:

### 1. Install PostgreSQL Driver
```bash
npm install pg
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/dygus_db?schema=public"

# Application Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# JWT Configuration (if using authentication)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

### 3. Database Setup
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Create and apply database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# (Optional) Seed the database
npx prisma db seed
```

### 4. Database Management
```bash
# Open Prisma Studio to manage your data
npx prisma studio

# Reset database (WARNING: This will delete all data)
npx prisma migrate reset
```

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project
## First, generate the Prisma client
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## API Documentation (Swagger) will be available 
```bash
## This way itâ€™s **short, step-by-step, and very understandable for any user**.  
## Do you also want me to make it in a **copy-paste friendly quick start section** (just commands + Swagger link), without explanations?

# Local:
$ http://localhost:3000/api-docs

#Production: 
https://dygus.api/api-docs

```
## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
